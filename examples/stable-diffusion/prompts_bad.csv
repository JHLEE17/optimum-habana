"Create an illustration depicting a whimsical, surreal scene titled 'Monday: the day my brain runs on low battery mode.' Center a cartoonish human character with disheveled hair and sleepy eyes, slumped over a cluttered desk filled with empty coffee cups and crumpled papers. Their head is humorously shaped like a battery icon, showing a low charge with a red warning light. Surround the character with floating, translucent thought bubbles that contain faded, jumbled ideas and tasks. Use a muted color palette of grays and soft pastels to evoke a dreary Monday atmosphere, contrasted by the vibrant red of the battery warning. Soft, diffused lighting casts gentle shadows, enhancing the sleepy mood. Incorporate whimsical elements like a clock with melting numbers and a cat curled up on the desk, embodying the slow pace of the day. Consider a cartoonish, illustrative style with a touch of surrealism to amplify the dreamlike quality of the scene.",
